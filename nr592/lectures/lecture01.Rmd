### What we will cover in this course

* **See the [Syllabus](../syllabus_spring2019.html) and [Course Schedule](../schedule_spring2019.html)**  

* **Objectives (from [Syllabus](../syllabus_spring2019.html))**  

    * Set up a convenient computing workflow  

    * Write clean, thoroughly commented R code  

    * Recognize different types of data, how they are measured, and how they are
    handled in R  

    * Use the principle of 'tidy data' to effectively clean and format messy
    data sets  

    * Creatively explore data sets with descriptive statistics and rough
    visualizations prior to confirmatory analyses  

    * Clearly communicate results by visualizing data simply and effectively and
    by telling a compelling story with data  

    * Conduct basic statistical tests and linear regression modeling  

    * Explore advanced topics in data analysis, including dimensionality
    reduction and structural equation modeling  

    * Utilize R for your own research by developing a research question,
    collecting and wrangling data, and conducting the appropriate analyses  

    * Support reproducible research by documenting and embedding analyses in a
    written report  

    * Use the skills you have learned to communicate your process and results to
    a general audience  


<br>


### What we will not cover

* R Markdown (_kind of_) and R Notebook  

* LaTeX  

* Version control  
    * Git / GitHub  

        <!-- end of list -->

* Tibbles (`tibble` package) and piping (`magrittr` package)  

<br>

## Setting up a computing workflow

Create a folder structure for this course (see recommendations in required
reading by FitzJohn):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nr592/
├── data/
├── docs/
├── figs/
├── output/
└┬─ R/
 ├─ assignment1.R
 └─ lecture01.R
```

Create a project for this course:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nr592/
├── data/
├── docs/
├── figs/
├── output/
├── R/
└── nr592.Rproj
```


<br>


## Basic concepts in R

<big>**DON'T BE AFRAID TO FAIL!**</big>

Run current line/selection of code:  

* Ctrl+Enter (Windows)  
* Command+Enter (Mac)  

Source: [RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts)

### Objects

#### Variables

**Assignment**

```{r}
a = 1
b = 2
c = 42
```

```{r}
a
b
c
```


**Operations**

```{r}
a + b
a^2 + b^2
c / (a + b)
```

**Reassignment**

```{r}
a
b

a = a + b
a

a = a + b
a

a = a + b
a
```


### Scripts

Always work in scripts!

Open a new R script:

* Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows)  
* Command+Shift+N (Mac)  


#### Commenting  

```{r}
# "This line is commented out."
"This line is not commented out."
```

Comment/uncomment line:  

* Ctrl+Shift+C (Windows)  
* Command+Shift+C (Mac)  

**An example of well-commented code:**

```{r}
# Load iris data
data(iris)

# View structure of iris data
str(iris)

# Subset iris data to Species versicolor
irisVe = subset(x=iris, subset=Species == "versicolor")

# Find correlation between sepal length and petal length in versicolor
cor(x=irisVe$Sepal.Length, y=irisVe$Petal.Length)  # Result: 0.754049
```

### Packages

### Projects

Working directory  
Relative paths



## Data types and classes

### Numeric

Continuous (floating point)  
- Real  
- Complex  
Discrete  
- Binary (logical/boolean)  
- Integer

### Ordinal

Ordered factor

### Categorical

String (character)
Factor

### Date  
lubridate



## Data structures

### Vectors

Can only have one type

### Matrices

### Data Frames

### Lists

### Functions

```{r}
a
b
c

mean(x=c(a, b, c))
```

Let's make our own function to add the variable `a` to the variable `b`.

```{r, error=TRUE}
a_plus_b = function(a, b){
  aPlusB = a + b
  return(aPlusB)
}

a_plus_b(a=1, b=5)
```

What if we just use `aPlusB` instead of the whole function?

```{r, error=TRUE}
aPlusB(a=1, b=5)
```

Why doesn't this work?

`aPlusB` is a variable, not a function. You can't pass other variables to it.

Let's see what value is stored for the `aPlusB` variable.

```{r, error=TRUE}
aPlusB
```

Why doesn't this work?

`aPlusB` only exists inside the `a_plus_b` function. It doesn't have a value assigned to it in the "global environment" that we're working in. (Look in the "Environment" tab in RStudio.) `aPlusB` is called an "internal variable" because it only assigned inside the function when it's called, and is removed as soon as the function is finished running.



## Operations

### Common Functions
str()
names()
class()
dim()
length()
nrow()
ncol()
gc()
?
View()

### Subsetting
