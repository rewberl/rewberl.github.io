# Concept

Understand the theory of evolution by natural selection by creating a fictional population of “beasts” and observing evolution in action over multiple generations.

# Introduction

Back in the 1800’s, after each traveling the world and seeing all kinds of fascinating and bizarre plants and animals, two British naturalists—one named Charles Darwin and the other named Alfred Russell Wallace—both independently came to the conclusion that all living things **evolve** in response to a force called **natural selection**.

The idea that organisms change over time was not new. Ancient Greeks, Arabs, and Romans had all developed evolutionary ideas many years before Darwin and Wallace. The revolutionary part of their theory was that nature “selects” which individuals are able to survive and reproduce based on how successful they are in their environment. Some individuals are slightly more likely to survive than the others they are competing with because every individual has a slightly different set of **traits**. Some traits help them to survive in a particular environment—these are called **adaptations**—and if they are more likely to survive they are also more likely to be able to reproduce. Over many generations where more and more of the most highly adapted organisms pass these adaptations on to their children, the population as a whole becomes more adapted to its environment. This is evolution by natural selection.

The presence of **variation** in traits is important to the process of adaptation because, if the environment changes, the set of traits that would be most adaptive in that environment will change. An organism’s fitness always depends on the environment at a particular time and place. Imagine a lizard suddenly being transported to the arctic, or a fish taken out of water. **Mutations** introduce new variation into a population, and can be passed onto offspring. This allows for populations to continue to adapt to new or changing environments.
