# Cultural Evolutionary Forces

## Social Learning Mechanisms ("How to Copy")

#### Imitation

> "a focus by the observer on the reproduction of the form of modeled actions rather than the result or goal of those actions"

(Berl & Hewlett 2015, p2)

* ##### Contextual imitation

    > "observing a demonstrator performing an action in a specific context directly causes an observer to learn to perform that action in the same context"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

* ##### Production imitation

    > "observing a demonstrator performing a novel action, or action sequence, that is not in its own repertoire causes an observer to be more likely to perform that action or sequence"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

* ##### Overimitation

    > "the high-fidelity copying of causally irrelevant actions in the presence of clear causal information"

    (Berl & Hewlett 2015, p2)

#### Emulation

> "observation of a demonstrator interacting with objects in its environment causes an observer becomes more likely to perform any actions that bring about a similar effect on those objects"

(Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

> "a focus on reaching the modeled outcome rather than on the details of the actions that accomplish that outcome"

(Berl & Hewlett 2015, p2)

#### Enhancement & Facilitation

* ##### Stimulus enhancement

    > "a demonstrator exposes an observer to a single stimulus, which leads to a change in the probability that the observer will respond to stimuli of that type"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

* ##### Local enhancement

    > "a demonstrator attracts an observer to a specific location, which can lead to the observer learning about objects at that location"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

* ##### Observational conditioning

    > "the behaviour of the demonstrator exposes an observer to a relationship between stimuli, enabling the observer to form an association between them"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

* ##### Social enhancement

    * ###### Social enhancement of food preferences

        > "exposure to a demonstrator carrying cues associated with a particular diet causes the observer to become more likely to consume that diet"

        (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

* ##### Response facilitation

    > "a demonstrator performing an act increases the probability that an animal that sees it will do the same. This can result in the observer learning about the context in which to perform the act and the consequences of doing so"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

* ##### Social facilitation

    > "when the mere presence of a demonstrator affects the observer’s behaviour, which can influence the observer’s learning"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)

* ##### Observational R-S learning

    > "Observation of a demonstrator exposes the observer to a relationship between a response and a reinforcer, causing the observer to form an association between them"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p69)




## Social Learning Strategies ("If/When To Copy")

> "evolved psychological rule specifying under what circumstances an individual learns from others and/or from whom they learn"

(Rendell et al. 2011, p68)




## Transmission Biases (“Who/What To Copy”)

### UNBIASED

> "the adoption of variants in proportion to their frequency"

(Hoppitt and Laland 2013, p240)

### GUIDED VARIATION

> "nonrandom changes in cultural variants by individuals that are subsequently transmitted"

(Richerson and Boyd 2005, p69)

> "a process by which individuals acquire information about any behavior from others and then modify the behavior based on their personal experience"

(Hoppitt and Laland 2013, p240)

* ##### Prestige-biased guided variation
> “[produced from the combination of] individual learning, infocopying, ranking abilities, and deference [at the population level]”

    (Henrich and Gil-White 2001, p175)

### CONTENT ("Direct")

> "individuals are more likely to learn or remember some cultural variants based on their content"

(Richerson and Boyd 2005, p69)

> "individuals choose one of two or more alternative traits to adopt according to some intrinsic quality of the trait"

(Hoppitt and Laland 2013, p240)

### CONTEXT

#### Model

> “choice of trait based on the observable attributes of the individuals who exhibit the trait”

(Richerson and Boyd 2005, p69)

* #### Indirect
    > “naive individuals prefer some models over others based on [a character that affects the importance of the individual] and use such preferences to determine the attractiveness of that model for other characters”

    (Boyd and Richerson 1985, p243)

    * ##### Prestige
        > skilled or successful individuals in the immediate circumstances

        (Miller & Dollard 1941, via Henrich and Gil-White 2001, p183)

        > “standing or estimation in the eyes of people; weight or credit in general opinion; commanding position in people's minds”

        (Henrich and Gil-White 2001, p166)

        > “the amounts and kinds of deference different models receive [used by naive individuals] as cues of underlying skill”

        (Henrich and McElreath 2003, p130)

        * ###### Dominance

        * ###### Status
            > “the amount of deference received”

            (Henrich and Gil-White 2001, p166)

#### Frequency

> "the use of commonness or rarity of a cultural variant as a basis for choice"

(Richerson and Boyd 2005, p69)

>"the commonness or rarity of a trait affects the probability of information transmission"

(Hoppitt and Laland 2013, p240)

* ##### Conformity

    > "positive frequency-dependent social learning for which the probability of acquiring a trait increases disproportionately with the number of demonstrators performing it"

    (Rendell et al. 2011, p68)

    > "positive frequency-dependent bias"

    (Hoppitt and Laland 2013, p240)




## Macro(co)evolutionary Forces

##### Natural selection

> "changes in the cultural composition of a population caused by the effects of holding one cultural variant rather than others... at individual or group levels"

(Richerson and Boyd 2005, p69)

### RANDOM FORCES

##### Cultural mutation

> "effects due to random individual-level processes"

(Richerson and Boyd 2005, p69)

##### Cultural drift

> "effects caused by statistical anomalies in small populations"

(Richerson and Boyd 2005, p69)

> "random, or unbiased, copying in which individuals acquire variants according to the frequency at which they are practiced"

(Rendell et al. 2011, p68)
