# General Questions

1. Are socio-ecological changes primarily the product of individual actors or of collective communities and institutions?
1. Are socio-ecological behaviors by actors the products of intentional decision-making or of unconscious strategies?
1. To what degree are the behaviors of individuals and institutions motivated by evolved psychological mechanisms as opposed to learned cultural values?
1. How can collective institutions like governments be made to learn and adapt?
1. Who benefits from adaptation? Who benefits from transformation? Which is the more socially equitable process?

# Lambin 2005

1. Do the three components of human-environment interactions mentioned in this article&mdash;*information*, *motivation*, and *capacity*&mdash;adequately account for the success or failure of sustainable resource management?
1. To what degree do the dimensions of the information component (temporal, historical, social, economic, socio-political) overlap or contrast with those of the other components?
    * i.e. Why does *information* have "social" and "socio-political" dimensions but *motivation* has "conflict of interest" and "institutional" dimensions?
1. To what degree are these divisions arbitrary? Is it really a failure of other studies that they have not considered all of these factors as specifically defined here?
1. Are the different dimensions just a re-branding of different types of capital? What would this imply?

# Nelson et al. 2007 (1/2)

1. The abstract begins, "Adaptation is a process of deliberate change..." Is this always the case? If unintentional societal change results in adaptation, is it still adaptation?
1. Does system transformation also have to be "deliberate" or "inadvertent" (p400)?
1. In biology, adaptation is never purposeful or directed. Whether a trait is "adaptive" depends wholly on the state of the environment at that particular time and, when environmental conditions change, the relative fitness benefits of traits change, which may result in different traits being "adaptive." Is this also the case with social systems, or are humans in control of their own socio-ecological evolution?
1. Further, the mechanisms of adaptation are the creation of random variation (*mutation*) and many, many iterations of failure (*selection*). Does social adaptation proceed differently? Why?

---

# Nelson et al. 2007 (2/2)

1. To what degree does culture influence adaptation and the perception of what is well-adapted?
1. Does adaptation involve different processes on different organizational levels?
1. What is the difference between *adaptive capacity* and *resilience*? How are they related?
1. Are societies only able to transition between certain desirable states? What defines the thresholds between states? What is the space between thresholds and states and how do societies move through it?
1. What is the role of history in adaptation?
1. If vulnerability can never be eliminated, just moved to different areas, people, and circumstances, how can we ensure that vulnerability analyses are ethical?

---

# Smit & Wandel 2006

1. These authors state that adaptation can be "anticipatory or reactive" and "autonomous or planned" (p282). How do we reconcile this with Nelson et al. (2007)?
1. Since it is now relatively certain that we will have to endure the effects of antropogenic climate change for decades (if not centuries) to come, should the focus of policy and research shift to adaptation to those effects rather than mitigation of the causes?
1. Does there need to be more focus on implementation? How can this be done when funding for implementation is generally provided by entities interested in profit, rather than welfare for its own sake?
1. If adaptations and adaptive capacity are context-specific and variable over both time and space, what implications does this have for implementation?

---

# Turner et al. 2003 (1/2)

1. The authors explain that entitlement creates uneven distributions of risk and coping capacity (i.e. "adaptive capacity") within societies, and presumably between them. Is this adequately addressed in the model?
1. Compared to the RH and PAR frameworks, the vulnerability framework is much more complex. The authors state the advantages of this, but may it also be a problem? Does it reduce the generalizability of a place-based approach to have a more complex and specific model?
1. How could the vulnerability model be adopted?
